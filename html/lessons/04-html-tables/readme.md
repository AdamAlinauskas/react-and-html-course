# Lesson 04 - HTML Tables

The `<table>` element represents tabular data â€” that is, information presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.

## Structuring Tables

There are a mix of tags that go along with making a table in html:

- `<table>` - the root level element
- `<thead>` - optional, signifies that the child elements are going to be headings for the table
- `<tbody>` - signifies that the child elements are going to be the contents for the table
- `<tr>` - indicates a row in the table (table row)
- `<td>` - indicates a cell in the table (table data)
- `<th>` - indicates a cell in the table that is a heading (table heading). To be used inside a `<thead>`

Take a look at the following example:

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Bob</td>
      <td>25</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Joe</td>
      <td>33</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

Let's break the above down a bit.

We start off with the main `<table>` element. This contains all of the elements involved in building the table itself.

```diff
+ <table>
    ...
+ </table>
```

Then we have the table heading (`<thead>`) indicating that we are going to be defining the headers for the table inside.

```diff
<table>
+  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
+  </thead>

  ...
</table>
```

Inside the `<thead>` we have a single `<tr>` to indicate that we need a row

```diff
<table>
  <thead>
+    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
+    </tr>
  </thead>

  ...
</table>
```

Inside the `<tr>` we then specify two table headings `<th>`, `name` and `height`

```diff
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
+      <th>Name</th>
+      <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  ...
</table>
```

Next to (not inside) the `<thead>` component, we have the `<tbody>` indicating that what is inside will have the tables contents.

```diff
<table>
  <thead>
    ...
  </thead>

+  <tbody>
    ...
+  </tbody>
</table>
```

Inside the `<tbody>` we have two `<tr>` elements, indicating that this table has two rows.

```diff
<table>
  ...

  <tbody>
+    <tr>
      <td>Bob</td>
      <td>25</td>
+    </tr>

+    <tr>
      <td>Joe</td>
      <td>33</td>
+    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

And inside each row, we have two `<td>` elements. The order of these elements is important as they must be in the same order as the table heading (if present).

```diff
<table>
  ...

  <tbody>
    <tr>
+      <td>Bob</td>
+      <td>25</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
+      <td>Joe</td>
+      <td>33</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

This code would produce the following table

| Name | Age |
| ---- | --- |
| Bob  | 25  |
| Joe  | 33  |

## Empty Cells

Let's say we don't know Bob's name, only his age. We can't just exclude the `<td>` tag containing his name. We'd have to provide it an empty one so that it still gets formatted properly.

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <!-- empty tag -->
      <td>25</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Joe</td>
      <td>33</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

This would produce

| Name | Age |
| ---- | --- |
|      | 25  |
| Joe  | 33  |

Vs if we just removed the tag, it would think that Bob's age is actually his name, due to the number of headings

```html
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <!-- deleted tag -->
      <td>25</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>Joe</td>
      <td>33</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

| Name | Age |
| ---- | --- |
| 25   |
| Joe  | 33  |
