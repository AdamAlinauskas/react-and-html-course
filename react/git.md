# Version Control + Git

What is version control? [At a high level, from a more detailed Atlassian article](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control):

> Version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time. Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

Essentially version control is a concept that allows developers to track changes to a code base and view a history of changes along the way.

Since version control is just a concept we need a tool to actually handle it for us. [Introducing, `git`](https://git-scm.com).
